# Combine Simple search and advanced search into a single search w/ dropdown
# Add an "edit" route for datastore submissions
# Default the /datastore/:slug/:id route to be "review mode" with an edit button
# On Submit of New Submission, Toast "Successfully created (Handle)" and display "new" route to add another record
# Add Prev/Next buttons on Submission View (if there is a next in list)
# On initial display of Search Page, update empty state to "Enter a Search term and click search to find records"
## We need to differentiate between no search results found and not searching yet
# Build Bridges automatically in Datastore Form config screens
